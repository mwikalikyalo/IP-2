## Description
This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
**The webpage works on a web browser so the only setup requirement is to click on the live link. It can be accessed on the internet using a laptop, phone or tablet.***
## Known Bugs
None that I am aware of.
## Technologies Used
I used HTML for the web structure, CSS for styling the landing page and JavaScript for functionality.
## Support and contact details
If any issues are spotted or have questions, ideas or concerns, contact me and or make a contribution to the code.
